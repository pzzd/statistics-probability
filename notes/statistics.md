# Statistics

## Intro

**Descriptive** statistics refers to methods for describing data succinctly. It uses measures of central tendency (e.g., median, mean, mode).

**Inferential** statistics is drawing conclusions about data.

"Average" is a "typical" or "middle" value, a value of central tendency. Here are some "middle" values:

**Mean** is the sum of values divided by the number of values.

**Midrange** is the mean of the highest and lowest values.

**Mode** is the most common value.

**Range** is the highest value minus the lowest value.

**Median** is the middle value, or the average of the two middle values if you have an even number of values.


## Mean Absolute Deviation

MAD gives a single figure for central tendency: it is the average of all the absolute deviations of each individual from the mean.

Example: With a dataset of {2, 2, 4, 4}, the mean is 3. MAD is 
(|2-3| + |2-3| + |4-3| + |4-3|) / 4 = 4/4 = 1

## Two-way tables

A two-way table has two variables, one on each axis. It has a join distribution along two dimensions.

Marginal distribution focuses on one dimesion. It is labeled at the margin of the two-way table. It is the total at the end of the row or column, and it could be a count or percentage.

Conditional distribution is the distribution of one variable given the other variable: that is, an entire single column or row. Usually a percentage is used, calculatged with the row or column total.

### "Calculate the conditional distribution of _y-axis var_ for each _x-axis var_." 
This means to use the y-axis total. You want the distribution of y-axis variables of each x-axis variable. It's also called "column-relative" frequencies. Remember: this allows you to compare percentanges, not raw numbers.

| | x var 1 | x var 2 | x totals |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| y var 1 | | | |
| y var 2 | | | |
| y totals | | | |
