# Statistics

## Intro

**Descriptive** statistics refers to methods for describing data succinctly. It uses measures of central tendency (e.g., median, mean, mode).

**Inferential** statistics is drawing conclusions about data.

"Average" is a "typical" or "middle" value, a value of central tendency. 

Arithmetic mean is the sum of values divided by the number of values.

## Mean Absolute Deviation

MAD gives a single figure for central tendency: it is the average of all the absolute deviations of each individual from the mean.

Example: With a dataset of {2, 2, 4, 4}, the mean is 3. MAD is 
(|2-3| + |2-3| + |4-3| + |4-3|) / 4 = 4/4 = 1
