## Sampling distributions

Sampling lets you learn parameters about a population when it is difficult or impossible to know the popluation's exact parameters. For example, sampling allows you to estimate a population mean or standard deviation. To estimate a popuation statistic, take a random sample and calculate the statistic on the sample.
