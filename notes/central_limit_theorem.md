## Sampling distributions

Sampling lets you learn parameters about a population when it is difficult or impossible to know the popluation's exact parameters. For example, sampling allows you to estimate a population mean or standard deviation. To estimate a population statistic, take a random sample and calculate the statistic on the sample.

A sampling distribution is the frequency with which you can get different values for a statistic that is trying to estimate a parameter.

Example: Imagine a bucket with three balls. Each ball has a number value on it: 1, 2, 3. We know the whole population and the so we know the population mean μ = (1 + 2 + 3)/3 = 2. Now can draw random samples of size 2 (draw with replacement to keep it random). All the possible values of sample mean x̄ are:

| drawn numbers | x̄ |
| --- | --- |
| 1,1|1|
| 1,2|1.5|
| 1,3|2|
| 2,1|1.5|
| 2,2|2|
| 2,3|1.5|
| 3,1|2|
| 3,2|2.5|
| 3,3|3|
