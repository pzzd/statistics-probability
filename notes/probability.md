## Linear transformations on a probability distribution

If you **add to** a random variable, the mean will change byt he amount added, but the standard deviation will stay the same. This is easy to see with a graph. Here, X is a random variable, k is a constant.

- Y = X + k
- Mean of Y = Mean of X + k
- Standard deviation of Y = standard deviation of X

Visually, we just scotted X over to the right by k.

When you scale a random variable (i.e., multiply it by a constant), it scales both the mean and the standard deviation by the same constant.

- Z = kX
- Mean of Z = k(Mean of X)
- Standard deviation of Z = k(standard deviation of X)

Visually, you stretch by k horizontally, and vertically, you flatten by k. This preserves the area under the curve. **Need more detail here.**
