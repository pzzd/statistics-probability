## Linear transformations on a probability distribution

If you **add to** a random variable, the mean will change byt he amount added, but the standard deviation will stay the same. This is easy to see with a graph. Here, X is a random variable, k is a constant.

- Y = X + k
- Mean of Y = Mean of X + k
- Standard deviation of Y = standard deviation of X
