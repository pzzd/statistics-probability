# Permutations

Permutations means 'the number of ways items can be arranged'. For example, how many ways can 5 people be seated in 5 chairs.

The number of permutations is calculated with a factorial. In a case where there are n items and n places, it's n!.

The example shows why you would multiply using a factorial. In the first chair, you could have any one of 5 people. In the second chair there are 4 people left, so there is a possibility of any of the 4 in the second chair combined with the first chair. The third chair can go to any of the remaining 3 people, the fourth chair to any of the remaining 2 people, and the last chair must go to the one remaining person.

5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120

Here is a tree diagram to show permutations of 3 people in 3 chairs. Count the ends of the branches: 3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6.
