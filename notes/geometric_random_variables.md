# Geometric Random Variables

A geometric random variable is the number of trials it takes to get the first success; it has these characteristics:
- a trial outcome is a success or a failure
- the trial results are independent
- there is the same probability in each trial
- there is no fixed number of trials

Example: Y is the number of rolls you have to do until you get a 6 on a fair die. A 'success' outcome is rolling a 6. One roll result does not depend on another. The probability is the same in each roll. The minimum number of rolls is 1, and there is no maximum number of rolls. This is a geometric random variable.

"Geometric" refers to the fact that the probabilities of various outcomes look a lot like geometric growth. Related topics: geometric sequences and series.

## Example

You have a fair 6-sided die. Let X = the number of rolls until you get a 1. That is, you stop rolling when you get a 1.
- The probability of rolling a 1 P(X = 1) on the first roll is 1/6. The probability of rolling a 1 on the second roll P(X = 2) is 5/6*1/6; 5/6 is for rolling any other number than 1. This pattern continues because we don't know how many rolls until you get a 1!
- P(X = 1) = 1/6
- P(X = 2) = (5/6)(1/6)
